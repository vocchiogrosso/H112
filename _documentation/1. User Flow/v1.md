## System

1. **Contractor** `>logs in<` and on `/contractor/dashboard` page, sets *rate* and sets *status* to available
2. **User** `>logs in<` and clicks `>create load<` button on dashboard.
4. **User** fills out `>load description<` on `user/request/`
5. **Manager** settings on `/manager/requirements` will use an Algorithm to determine `Avaibility Components` details such as *pricing* and *estimated time*
6. **User**  will pay based on the generated pricing on `/user/request/payment` and `**request**` becomes `**workload`
7. **System** assigns workload to contractor which gets added to `/contractor/schedule` and create *status* on `/request/status` for **User**
8. **Contractor** can see schedule of workloads and click on active one to open `/contractor/navigation`
9. **Contractor** can mark completed and *status* on `/request/status` will change to complete and delete/archive
