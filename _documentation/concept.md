# RouteSync Challenge

## Problem Description

Design a formula to calculate the efficiency of transporting goods based on time and cost per mile driven by a truck. The truck can have partial loads but should prioritize maximizing its capacity without going too far off the planned route. Generally, the outbound trip will be fully loaded, but the inbound trip might have one full or one to two partial loads.

## Algorithmic Solution

To solve this problem, we need to devise an algorithm that can find the most efficient loads for the inbound trip. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

### Step 1: Define Parameters

- Truck Capacity: Maximum volume the truck can carry.
- Load Details: Details of potential loads (volume and location).
- Cost per Mile: Cost incurred per mile driven.
- Time Matrix: Matrix representing the time taken between different locations.
- Max Deviation Distance: Maximum distance the truck can deviate from its path to pick up a load.

### Step 2: Algorithm Development

#### Step 2.1: Initialization
- Initialize the outbound trip with a full load.
- Create an empty list to store the selected inbound loads.
- Calculate the direct route time and distance for the return trip without any load.

#### Step 2.2: Inbound Load Selection
1. Identify potential loads that are along the return path or within the maximum deviation distance from the path.
2. Create combinations of one or two loads and evaluate them based on:
   - Total volume (should not exceed truck capacity).
   - Total deviation distance (should not exceed the max deviation distance).
   - Total time and cost for the return trip with the selected loads.

#### Step 2.3: Optimal Load Selection
3. Select the load combination that maximizes the total volume without exceeding the truck's capacity and minimizes the total time and cost.

### Step 3: Implementation in Python

The following is a conceptual representation of the algorithm in Python pseudocode:

```python
def calculate_efficiency(truck_capacity, loads, cost_per_mile, time_matrix, max_deviation_distance):
    # Step 2.1: Initialization
    inbound_loads_selected = []
    direct_route_time, direct_route_distance = calculate_direct_route(return_trip_details)

    # Step 2.2: Inbound Load Selection
    potential_loads = identify_potential_loads(loads, return_trip_details, max_deviation_distance)

    best_load_combination = None
    best_efficiency_score = float('inf')

    for load_combination in generate_load_combinations(potential_loads, truck_capacity):
        total_volume, total_deviation_distance, total_time, total_cost = evaluate_load_combination(load_combination, time_matrix, cost_per_mile)

        if total_volume <= truck_capacity and total_deviation_distance <= max_deviation_distance:
            efficiency_score = calculate_efficiency_score(total_volume, total_time, total_cost, direct_route_time, direct_route_distance)

            if efficiency_score < best_efficiency_score:
                best_efficiency_score = efficiency_score
                best_load_combination = load_combination

    # Step 2.3: Optimal Load Selection
    inbound_loads_selected.extend(best_load_combination)

    return inbound_loads_selected, best_efficiency_score

```

## calculate_direct_route

```python

def calculate_direct_route(return_trip_details):
    # Here you can use return_trip_details to calculate the direct route time and distance.
    # This is a placeholder implementation, and you'll need to replace it with your actual calculation.
    
    direct_route_time = 0  # Replace with actual calculation
    direct_route_distance = 0  # Replace with actual calculation
    
    return direct_route_time, direct_route_distance

```

## identify_potential_loads

```python

def identify_potential_loads(loads, return_trip_details, max_deviation_distance):
    potential_loads = []
    
    for load in loads:
        deviation_distance = calculate_deviation_distance(return_trip_details, load)
        
        if deviation_distance <= max_deviation_distance:
            potential_loads.append(load)
    
    return potential_loads

def calculate_deviation_distance(return_trip_details, load):
    # Calculate the deviation distance for picking up a specific load
    # Replace with your actual calculation
    return 0

```

## generate_load_combinations

```python

from itertools import combinations

def generate_load_combinations(potential_loads, truck_capacity):
    for i in range(1, 3):  # 1 or 2 loads
        for combo in combinations(potential_loads, i):
            if sum(load['volume'] for load in combo) <= truck_capacity:
                yield combo

```

## evaluate_load_combination

```python

def evaluate_load_combination(load_combination, time_matrix, cost_per_mile):
    total_volume = sum(load['volume'] for load in load_combination)
    total_deviation_distance = sum(load['deviation_distance'] for load in load_combination)
    total_time = sum(time_matrix[load['pickup_location']][load['drop_location']] for load in load_combination)
    total_cost = total_deviation_distance * cost_per_mile
    
    return total_volume, total_deviation_distance, total_time, total_cost

```

##  calculate_efficiency_score

```python
def calculate_efficiency_score(total_volume, total_time, total_cost, direct_route_time, direct_route_distance):
    # Here, define a formula to calculate the efficiency score.
    # This can be a weighted sum or any other formula that meets your requirements.
    
    # Placeholder formula, replace with your actual formula.
    efficiency_score = (total_volume / direct_route_distance) - (total_time + total_cost)
    
    return efficiency_score
